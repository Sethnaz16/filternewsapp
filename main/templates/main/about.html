        <p>In this day and age, fake news is everywhere. When you can't be sure a news source is telling the truth or
        seeking political or monetary gain, the average citizen is hurt the most. This leaves the need for a way to check
        if a given news source is reliable or not. Group #9 has developed just such a web application so you too can
        determine if a news source is feeding you facts, or fiction.</p>
